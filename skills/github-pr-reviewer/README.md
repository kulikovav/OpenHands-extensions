# GitHub PR Reviewer

Create an automation that reviews GitHub pull requests when a configurable
reviewer is requested or a trigger label is applied.

## Trigger

This skill is activated by:

- `/pr-reviewer:setup`

## Features

- Reviews PRs on demand from a GitHub reviewer request or label event
- Gates each scheduled review on the current head's GitHub-required checks
  before starting an agent, read through the `isRequired` signal, so an optional
  workflow that fails cannot block a mergeable head: a completed `failure`,
  `cancelled`, or `timed_out` required check blocks the review, and a `queued`,
  `in_progress`, or not-yet-reported required check exits with a clear
  waiting-on-checks outcome instead of holding a slot. If the required-check
  signal is unavailable the gate falls back to every current-head check run and
  workflow run, including a workflow that fails before creating any check run
- Dispatches an explicit `all-hands-bot` review request even when required CI is
  red or pending; the CI gate applies to scheduled discovery
- Ignores checks and workflow runs recorded for an obsolete head, so a stale
  failure cannot block the push that fixed it
- Explicit reviewer requests include draft PRs in both event mode and scheduled
  scans; drafts without a request or trigger label remain excluded
- Resumes an outstanding reviewer request on the next scheduled scan once the
  requested head's checks are green, so a request that arrives during CI is not
  lost; the explicit-request event path is kept for event-only deployments
- Reviews open, non-draft PRs that nobody requested on a scheduled scan once
  their current head is green and carries no review yet, keyed by
  repository/PR/head so a repeat scan never duplicates a conversation or review
  and a changed head becomes eligible again
- Examines the whole unrequested backlog on each scheduled scan, while the
  global `max_new_per_run` quota limits only newly created review conversations;
  blocked or pending heads consume no launch slot
- Posts no managed gate comment for an unrequested PR that is merely red or
  pending - the comment answers an explicit request, so a scan over a large
  backlog cannot storm the PRs with comments
- Names the retry the deployment actually has in the waiting comment: a
  scheduled scan where a cron trigger exists, and removing and re-requesting the
  bot where only the event trigger does
- Rewrites its own managed gate comment in place when the retry wording changes,
  so switching a deployment from the event trigger to a cron scan updates the
  outstanding-request explanation instead of leaving the old instruction
- Watches several repositories from a single automation, each with its own state
- Bounds a scheduled scan to a small, configurable number of new review
  conversations across all repositories (default 2), draining the oldest
  outstanding reviewer requests first and reaching the rest on later scans
- Processes each review request or label application idempotently
- Supports re-review by requesting the bot again or re-applying the label. Each
  explicit request refreshes mutable GitHub state (head, PR body, reviews,
  comments, review requests, linked issues, and current-head checks) instead of
  trusting what an earlier turn observed, so a same-head re-review sees a linked
  issue that has since gained or lost readiness, or a check that has since moved.
  Repository analysis already done, such as reading `AGENTS.md`, is retained
- Suppresses stale reviews when the PR head commit changes mid-review
- Hands the agent the reviewed commit already checked out, and removes that
  checkout when the review ends, so nothing accumulates between runs
- Publishes a real pull request review, with inline comments where a finding
  maps to a changed line, and verifies on GitHub that it landed
- Requires live evidence from the real app before approving a user-visible UI
  change when the repository's guidance demands it: unit tests, CSS-token
  assertions, generated mockups, and reconstructed captures cannot substitute.
  Missing evidence yields a COMMENT review that names the gap, so no approval
  and no maintainer handoff
- Posts acknowledgement comments with AI disclosure
- Configurable review tone and polling schedule
- Optional human handoff after an exact-head approval. The scanner ranks the
  configured maintainers by recent commits to changed paths, then by their open
  GitHub review-request count, and requests one without merging the PR. Use at
  least two repository collaborators so a maintainer can author a PR without
  leaving the handoff roster empty.

## Prerequisites

Set `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` in OpenHands Settings -> Secrets. The token
must be able to read the repositories and their contents, read issue events,
write issue comments, and **write pull request reviews** — the review is
published and the optional human reviewer is requested through the pull request
API, so read-only pull request access is not enough.

## Quick Start

Ask OpenHands for either trigger mode:

> "Set up a PR review automation for my `myorg/backend` and `myorg/frontend`
> repos when `all-hands-bot` is requested, using concise reviews."

After setup, request the configured bot on a pull request to queue a review. To
request another review later, request the bot again. Scheduled installations
can instead use a configured label and re-apply it for another review.
