"""
GitLab Issue to MR - OpenHands Automation Script

Cron-polls one or more GitLab projects for open issues carrying the configured
trigger label. Work is queued only when the latest matching GitLab label
resource event has not already been processed by this automation.

Each project is polled independently and keeps its own state document, so issue
IIDs never collide across projects.

The agent is told which issue to implement and finishes the job: it reads the
issue and its discussion itself, writes the code, commits, pushes the branch, and
opens the merge request, so the merge request appears as soon as it stops rather
than on the next poll.

The script owns everything around that, and guarantees the outcome. It clones the
default branch, creates the working branch, and when the conversation ends it
asks GitLab whether the merge request exists. If it does not - the agent gave up,
errored, or its push failed - the script commits whatever was left, pushes, and
opens the merge request itself. Either way it comments on the issue and removes
the clone.

On OpenHands Cloud and Enterprise each conversation runs in a sandbox of its own
rather than in a clone this script keeps, so the agent clones the project itself
and a conversation that ends without a merge request is reported on the issue
instead of being finished here.
